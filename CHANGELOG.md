# Changelog

## [3.4.1] 2026-7-01

### Added
- **Diagnostic logging for headless auto-start**: when a request to an offline world doesn't spawn a headless session, the relay now logs exactly why at every decision point instead of silently returning `404 No connected Foundry clients found`. Covered cases: headless disabled (`ALLOW_HEADLESS=false`) logged at startup and per request; no `clientId` to target (the common trip-up — the `x-client-id` header is not read, so the id must be a `?clientId=<world>` query param or the API key must be bound to a single client); client not a known client for the account; auto-start not enabled in the Connections tab; no credential assigned; the assigned credential missing/unowned; and password decryption failing (e.g. `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` changed since the credential was saved). Each blocked reason is greppable via a stable `Headless auto-start blocked: …` message. Logs include `clientId`/`userId`/`credentialId` but never passwords, tokens, or API keys.

### Fixed
- **Docs: incorrect quick-start / permission-filtering examples**: the docs landing-page cURL example told users to pass the client id as an `x-client-id` header (never read by the relay) and hit `/api/search` (wrong — API routes have no `/api` prefix), which is what led self-hosters to get `404 No connected Foundry clients found`. It now uses `GET /search` with `clientId` as a query parameter (and `filter=Actor` instead of the non-existent `type` param). `permission-filtering.md` similarly used non-existent `/api/entity/get`, `/entity/get`, `/api/entity/update`, and `/api/utility/execute-js` paths; corrected to the real root-level routes (`/get`, `/update`, `/execute-js`).
- **D&D 5e roll endpoints on Foundry v14 (dnd5e 5.x)**: `/dnd5e/skill-check`, `/ability-check`, `/ability-save`, `/death-save`, and `/concentration-save` returned no roll `total` (death-save errored) on the dnd5e 5.x system. Fixed in the module's dnd5e adapter (companion change — see the module changelog): rolls now branch on the dnd5e system version and use the 5.x config-based advantage API. The integration suite now runs green on Foundry **v12, v13, and v14**; the `transfer-currency` test funds the source actor first (dnd5e 5.x heroes start with no currency) rather than assuming a starting balance.

## [3.4.0] 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Admin Users tab — search, filter, sort, and inline management**: the operator admin panel's Users tab now supports full-text search (matches email or user ID), server-side filtering by role, status, email-verified, rotation-required, and subscription, and click-to-sort on every column (id, email, role, status, verified, rotation, subscription, requests today/month). Subscription, email-verified, and account status are now editable inline per row, and a new **Send Reset** action emails the user a password-reset link (1-hour expiry, prior tokens invalidated). The email and subscription columns are width-capped (email truncates with a hover tooltip) so the per-row action buttons stay visible without horizontal scrolling. All new endpoints stay behind the existing admin JWT + IP allowlist, validate inputs server-side, only interpolate whitelisted sort columns (values are always parameterized), and write audit-log entries. Verified against both SQLite and PostgreSQL, with integration coverage for search/filter/sort, subscription/verified edits, and the password-reset action.
- **Default world on stored credentials**: the Foundry Credentials page now has an optional **World** field (a world title or id). When a headless session auto-starts from a credential and Foundry is on the setup/world-list screen, the relay launches this world; if left blank it falls back to the world that Known Client last connected as. Closes the gap where auto-start had no world to select. World matching on the setup screen now accepts either the world's display title or its id.

### Changed
- **Actor SSE subscriptions can omit `actorUuid`**: subscribing to the `actor` SSE channel with no (or an empty) `actorUuid` now streams events for *all* actors on the client instead of returning `400 'actorUuid' is required`. Pass a specific `actorUuid` to filter to a single actor as before.

### Fixed
- **Headless auto-start never triggered for direct REST/SSE calls to an offline world** (e.g. a Discord bot using a scoped key). `AuthMiddleware` rejected a request whose `?clientId=` pointed at an offline client with a `404 Invalid client ID` *before* the handler's auto-start logic could run. It now lets the request through when the client is offline but owned by the account and flagged for auto-start, so the handler can spawn the headless session. The SSE subscribe endpoints (`/chat`, `/rolls`, `/encounters`, `/scene`, `/hooks`, `/actor` `…/subscribe`), which previously had no auto-start path at all, now attempt it too. Concurrent calls join the single in-flight launch.
- **Timestamps showing `12/31/1969` in the dashboard** (credential "Created", and any other `SQLiteTime` date): `SQLiteTime.Scan` couldn't parse the formats actually stored in SQLite — Go's `time.Time.String()` output (with its `m=+…` monotonic-clock suffix, written when a `Create` binds a raw `time.Time`) and legacy Sequelize `… +00:00` strings — so they decoded to the zero time (epoch). `Scan` now strips the monotonic suffix and tries the real-world layouts, preserving each value's timezone offset. Read-side fix: existing rows render correctly with no migration.
- **Combat SSE events were emitted with the module's wrapped envelope**: `fanoutCombatEvent` read `eventType`/`encounterId` from the outer `{type, data:{…}}` message instead of the nested `data`, so per-encounter SSE filtering never matched and subscribers received a doubly-nested payload. The relay now unwraps the inner payload so `eventType`/`encounterId` are top-level and encounter-scoped subscriptions filter correctly. (Companion to the module's combat-event changes — combatant names, `started` flag, and active-scene events.)

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Per-server identity for pairing**: worlds sharing a `worldId` slug on different Foundry servers no longer collide. The module sends a stable per-server fingerprint and its server origin when pairing; the relay matches fingerprint → stored clientId → worldId+origin to reuse the right `clientId` on re-pair (preserving cross-world settings, credentials, and notification config) and only mints a fresh id for a genuinely different server. The v3.0 `UNIQUE(userId, worldId)` constraint is retired accordingly.
- **`publicUrl` on known clients**: the browser `Origin` header is captured at pair/connect time and returned in `get-known-clients`, so modules can redirect players to the correct server address after a cross-server transfer without manual URL configuration.
- **Wildcard cross-world target**: "Allow all worlds" (`*`) can be granted from the dashboard's cross-world editors; mixed `["*", <id>, …]` selections collapse to just `["*"]`.
- **Cross-world approval page**: pre-populates the world's current scopes, targets, and rate limit; already-granted scopes are shown with a badge (and remain deselectable); warns when scopes are selected without targets or vice versa.
- Notification settings: new **"Cross-world activity occurs"** toggle — opt out of cross-world request notifications without disabling the activity log (previously always-on).
- New remote-request scope mappings (previously denied by default): `get-canvas-documents` (`canvas:read`); `create-canvas-document`, `update-canvas-document`, `delete-canvas-document`, `move-token` (`canvas:write`); `server-url` (`world:info`).
- **Docker-based integration testing** via `scripts/test-docker.sh [11|12|13|14]`: builds the relay image and spins up a quicksilvervtt-lite-managed Foundry (module pre-installed, passwordless GM) and runs the full suite against the stack — no manually-run Foundry needed. Configs in `test/foundry-configs/`; credentials via `.env.test.docker` (see `.env.test.docker.example`); host port configurable via `RELAY_HOST_PORT`.

### Changed
- Dashboard routes (`/auth/credentials`, `/auth/connection-tokens`, `/auth/api-keys`, approvals, audit logs, etc.) now use a dedicated session-only middleware: Bearer session tokens only, no x-api-key fallback, and invalid sessions return `"Invalid or expired session. Please log in again."` instead of the misleading `"API key is required"`. `AuthMiddleware` likewise rejects an invalid Bearer outright instead of falling through to x-api-key (integrations that send only `x-api-key` are unaffected).
- Dashboard logs out automatically when any authenticated request returns 401, instead of appearing logged-in with a dead session.
- Entity `create`: added `fullSync` option.
- Connections tab polish: world cards wrap on narrow screens, action buttons are smaller and stay inside the card, expanding one world's inactive browsers no longer re-renders all cards, and the Cross-world button shows a `●` when configured instead of a target count.
- Removed the redundant `shm_size`/`CHROME_ENABLE_SHM` guidance from compose files and GPU docs — Chrome runs with `--disable-dev-shm-usage` by default, so `/dev/shm` was never required for GPU acceleration.

### Security
- Wildcard `["*"]` in `requestedTargetClients` from the unauthenticated `POST /auth/pair-request` is stripped before storage — only the account owner can grant "all worlds" via the dashboard.
- `publicUrl` (browser Origin) is validated to a bare `http(s)` origin (no path/query/fragment, ≤ 512 chars) before storage, so a non-browser client can't plant an arbitrary redirect URL.
- A world can no longer send a cross-world remote request to its own clientId (a `*` allow-list would otherwise match the source itself).

### Fixed
- **Key-request approval was broken on PostgreSQL**: the approve UPDATE referenced camelCase columns unquoted, which Postgres case-folds to lowercase — the device flow stayed `"pending"` after a "successful" approval and web-flow exchange codes were never persisted, with the error silently swallowed. Identifier quoting is fixed in the shared `Col()` mapper and all key-request status updates now surface errors. (SQLite was unaffected; verified against both backends.)
- **Passwordless GMs can now log in headlessly**: the worker POSTs `/join` directly instead of submitting Foundry's login form, which drops an empty password field on submit.
- Cross-world rate limits chosen during pair-request approval are persisted through the pairing exchange instead of being reset to 0 (unlimited).
- Reconnects no longer blank out stored client metadata: the KnownClient upsert preserves existing values when an incoming field is empty (e.g. a connect that omits the custom name).
- Notification settings no longer overwrite `created_at` on every save.
- Deleting a world from the dashboard now removes its clientId from every sibling world's cross-world allow-list (wildcard lists are left untouched).
- Auto-start (`autoStartIfOffline`) hardening: concurrent requests for the same offline target join the in-flight launch instead of spawning parallel browsers; failures impose a 2-minute per-client cooldown that reports the original error; wrong world, unknown user, already-logged-in user, and rejected logins fail fast instead of burning the poll timeout (now 60s, down from 5 minutes).

### Testing
- The integration suite now runs cleanly against a remote/staging relay in pre-provisioned mode: session-only suites log in with `TEST_USER_EMAIL`/`TEST_USER_PASSWORD` (token cached across files), existing-session runs resolve `systemId`/`worldId` from `GET /clients`, `TEST_SKIP_ADMIN=true` (editable in the admin test-runner) skips the admin suites, a failed admin login stops retrying before tripping the login lockout, and WS rejection tests tolerate TLS-proxy close latency. Assorted test-correctness fixes (vacuous assertions, empty-password handling, auto-resolve client counting).

---

## [3.1.1] - 2026-05-06

- Updated deploy workflow version bump step to update docgen version number

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Integration test runner now samples CPU, RAM, GPU utilization, and VRAM every 3 seconds during the test run and prints a formatted resource usage report (with bar charts and peak/average/min stats) after all tests complete, alongside total test suite and test pass/fail counts
- `POST /dnd5e/modify-currency` — add or remove currency from a single actor (use a negative `amount` to deduct)
- `POST /dnd5e/prepare-spell` — toggle a spell's prepared state; only applies to spellcasters that prepare spells
- `ownedByUserId` query parameter on entity search — filter results to documents the specified Foundry user owns (by ID or username)
- `regions` canvas document type — full CRUD for Scene Regions (Foundry v12+); `regions` is the replacement for `templates` on Foundry v14+

### Changed
- Foundry module `module.json` `verified` updated from `"13"` to `"14"`
- `GET /clients` now includes offline known-client records alongside live connections; each entry has an `isOnline` field
- `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` are no longer required at startup — both are auto-generated on first run and persisted to `<DATA_DIR>/.secrets.env` (mode 0600). Environment variables still take precedence when set. If the encryption key is lost, users will need to re-enter any stored Foundry credentials.
- Docker Compose files (`docker-compose.local.yml`, `docker-compose.postgres.yml`) no longer require a `.env` file to start
- NVIDIA headless rendering now uses ANGLE Vulkan + native NVIDIA Vulkan ICD (`--use-angle=vulkan --use-vulkan=native --ozone-platform=headless`) — provides true hardware-accelerated WebGL; VirtualGL and all its dependencies have been removed from the image
- `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` and `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=graphics,utility` are now baked into the Dockerfile `ENV` — NVIDIA Option A users no longer need to add these variables to their compose file; the NVIDIA container runtime picks them up automatically at runtime and they have no effect when NVIDIA is not active
- `go-relay/Dockerfile` now explicitly installs `libvulkan1`, `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, `xvfb`, `libgl1-mesa-dri`, `libegl-mesa0`, `libegl1`, and `libglu1-mesa` to cover all rendering paths (NVIDIA Vulkan, Intel/AMD Mesa DRI, Xvfb software)

### Fixed
- `CONFIG.statusEffects` is now read correctly on Foundry v14, which changed the value from an Array to an Object keyed by ID; the `kill` entity action now correctly applies the dead/defeated status effect on v14
- Reconnects from the same IP address (e.g. after a network drop) no longer receive a `DuplicateConnection` (4004) rejection; the stale connection is silently replaced
- Headless session startup now polls for world-list readiness instead of checking once — fixes intermittent launch failures on Foundry v14 where the world list is rendered by JavaScript after initial page load
- Stale `isOnline` flags left by a crash or unclean shutdown are now cleared at startup on single-instance deployments
- Email verification page now renders styled HTML with distinct messaging for each state (expired link, invalid token, already verified, success)
- Admin users panel now shows each account's email verification status
- Dashboard Connections page memory leak: `tokenRow` snippet was defined inside the `{#each clients}` loop, causing a new closure to be created per client on every re-render; moved to component scope with an explicit `activeTokenId` parameter
- Dashboard Connections page: Map and Set reactive state (`worldNotifSettings`, `worldNotifOpen`, `worldNotifSaving`, `worldNotifTesting`, `worldNotifMsg`, `selectedTokenIds`, `expandedInactive`) now mutated in-place via Svelte 5 reactive proxy methods (`.set()`, `.add()`, `.delete()`, `.clear()`) instead of create-copy-assign, eliminating intermediate object allocations on every state change
- Xvfb virtual display now starts at 24-bit color depth (was 16-bit); fixes OpenGL/GLX context creation failures that caused canvas operations to silently produce blank output
- `libegl1` (GLVND EGL dispatcher) and `libglu1-mesa` are now explicitly installed in the image, fixing NVIDIA Vulkan ICD initialization

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-19

### New Features

#### Scoped API Key Permission System
Every API endpoint is now gated by a named scope. Master keys pass all scope checks automatically; scoped keys must explicitly include the required scope.
- 32 scope constants defined: `entity:read`, `entity:write`, `roll:read`, `roll:execute`, `chat:read`, `chat:write`, `encounter:read`, `encounter:manage`, `macro:list`, `macro:execute`, `macro:write`, `scene:read`, `scene:write`, `canvas:read`, `canvas:write`, `effects:read`, `effects:write`, `user:read`, `user:write`, `file:read`, `file:write`, `playlist:control`, `world:info`, `clients:read`, `sheet:read`, `session:manage`, `events:subscribe`, `execute-js`, `search`, `dnd5e`, `structure:read`, `structure:write`
- `DefaultScopes` — safe read-only set assigned to new keys
- `ActionToScopeRequired` map — all WS action types mapped to their required scope
- All routes wrapped in `scope(model.Scope...)` groups
- `RequireScope` middleware enforces scopes on HTTP requests
- Scoped key form updated with full scope checklist and danger warnings

#### World Pairing & Connection Tokens
A new device-flow pairing model replaces direct API key sharing.
- **Pair Request flow**: Foundry module initiates pairing without credentials; user approves in dashboard
  - `POST /auth/pair-request` — module sends world metadata and requested scopes
  - `GET /auth/pair-request/{code}/status` — module polls for approval
  - `POST /auth/pair-request/{code}/approve` — user grants access, optionally with cross-world settings
  - `POST /auth/pair-request/{code}/deny` — user rejects
  - Supports `upgradeOnly` mode for updating existing world permissions
- **Connection Tokens** (replaces raw API key in WebSocket URL):
  - `POST /auth/connection-tokens` — generate token from pairing code
  - `GET /auth/connection-tokens` — list all tokens
  - `PATCH /auth/connection-tokens/{id}` — update cross-world settings, rate limits
  - `DELETE /auth/connection-tokens/{id}` — revoke and force-disconnect live sessions
  - Tokens stored hashed (never in plaintext); bound to a specific client/world
- **Self-unpair**: `POST /api/self-unpair` — module can disconnect itself and clean up its token
- **PairApprovalPage** in dashboard for users to review and approve pairing requests with cross-world configuration

#### Cross-World Remote Request Tunnel
Worlds in the same account can now execute actions against each other over the relay.
- New `remote-request` WebSocket action: source world sends a request targeting another world
- Permission checks: target must be in `AllowedTargetClients`, scope must be in `RemoteScopes`
- Per-token rate limiting (`RemoteRequestsPerHour`)
- Auto-start headless session on target world if it is offline and `AutoStartOnRemoteRequest` is enabled
- Full audit log (`RemoteRequestLog`) with source token, target client, action, success/failure
- `RemoteRequestsPage` in dashboard shows all cross-world activity

#### OAuth-Style Key Request Flow
Third-party apps can request API keys without pre-shared credentials.
- `POST /auth/key-request` — app submits request with requested scopes, client list, suggested limits
- `GET /auth/key-request/{code}/status` — app polls for user approval
- `GET /auth/key-request/{code}` — fetch request details for dashboard approval UI
- `POST /auth/key-request/{code}/approve` — user grants scopes and selects accessible worlds
- `POST /auth/key-request/{code}/deny`
- `POST /auth/key-request/exchange` — web-flow code exchange to retrieve the approved key
- `KeyApprovalPage` in dashboard with scope matrix, danger warnings, client selector, rate limit and expiry configuration

#### Stored Foundry Credentials
- Users can store encrypted Foundry server credentials (URL, username, password) using AES-GCM encryption
- Used by headless sessions for automatic world login
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /auth/credentials` endpoints
- `CredentialsPage` in dashboard to manage saved credentials
- A world can be linked to a specific stored credential for headless auto-start

#### Known Clients Registry
- `KnownClient` records track paired Foundry worlds, their metadata, and cross-world settings
- `KnownUser` records track individual Foundry players per world (for scoped key references)
- `GET /auth/known-clients` — list all paired worlds with live/offline status

- `PATCH /auth/known-clients/{id}/auto-start` — toggle auto-start on remote-request
- `DELETE /auth/known-clients/{id}` — unpair a world
- `GET /auth/known-clients/{id}/users` — list stored Foundry users for a world
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /auth/known-clients/{id}/notification-settings` — per-world notification config
- `get-known-clients` WebSocket action returns world list with `canAutoStart`, `tokenScopes`, `tokenAllowedTargets`
- `ConnectionsPage` in dashboard for managing paired worlds and cross-world permissions

#### Notification System
Users can receive Discord or email alerts for events in their connected worlds.

- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds, pagination (50 per page)
- `ActivityLog` component in dashboard
- Three underlying log tables: connection events, cross-world requests, module events

#### Module Event Auditing
- `module-notify` WebSocket message type — module sends security-relevant events
