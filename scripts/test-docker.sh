#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run the integration suite against a Docker-managed Foundry + relay stack.
#
# Model: quicksilvervtt-lite runs the Foundry server (with the REST API module
# installed and enabled); the relay launches a headless browser against it via
# /start-session, and the module connects back to the relay. The Jest suite then
# drives the relay's HTTP API.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test-docker.sh [major-version]      # 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 (default 13)
#
# Credentials are read from an env file (default: .env.test.docker; override with
# ENV_FILE=path). It needs your foundryvtt.com account — the SAME variables as a
# quicksilvervtt-lite .env, so you can point ENV_FILE at one you already have:
#   FOUNDRY_USERNAME=you@example.com
#   FOUNDRY_PASSWORD=your-foundryvtt-password
#
# Optional env (file or shell):
#   MODULE_PATH  — path to the foundryvtt-rest-api checkout (default: ../foundryvtt-rest-api)
#   KEEP_RUNNING — if set, leave the stack up after tests (for debugging)
